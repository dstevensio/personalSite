To give a brief overview of what this is:
- My personal site, using node.js
- An early foray in to the world of node and as such, a learning tool.
- A playground, susceptible to radical changes on a whim.

The ever-evolving TODO list:
- Currently using very basic usage of Mustache.js templating. Going to switch to Mu, which is faster & made for Node.
- All data is just dumped in a collection of JS files and pulled in via a require, this was always intended to be a stopgap solution. Switch to CouchDB for storage.
- Very basic styling, lots more to do there.
- Ajax-ifying things so that I'm making use of faux-page refreshing and what not.
- A metric s-ton of additional sections so that there's actually a point to having this site.
